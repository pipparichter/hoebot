#MemeBot GroupMe Bot

MemeBot is an interactive GroupMe bot which responds to messages sent into a specified group (see global_vars.py). Responses are canned, and the more complex (dynamic) responses are implemented using functions in the 'triggers.py' module. 

##Current functionality:

*Canned responses
	*hello, memebot --> hello there
	*thanks, memebot --> don't mention it
*Dynamic responses
	*meme me --> heck ya, what category of meme (nerdy, wholesome, inside jokes) --> here ya go [returns image from meme_lib.
