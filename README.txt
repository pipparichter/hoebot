HoeBot is an interactive GroupMe bot which responds to messages sent into a specified group (see global_vars.py). No natural language processing is used (until I figure out how to do that), sorry. Responses are canned, and the more complex (dynamic) responses are implemented using functions in the 'triggers.py' module.
