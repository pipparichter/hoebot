Description: # MemeBot GroupMe Bot
        
        MemeBot is an interactive GroupMe bot which responds to messages sent into a specified group (see global_vars.py). Responses are canned, and the more complex (dynamic) responses are implemented using functions in the 'triggers.py' module. 
        
        ## Current functionality:
        
        * Canned responses
        	* hello, memebot --> hello there
        	* thanks, memebot --> don't mention it
        * Dynamic responses
        	* meme me --> heck ya, what category of meme (nerdy, wholesome, inside jokes) --> here ya go [returns image from meme_lib.py]
